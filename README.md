# Testing

This project was generated with [Angular CLI] version 15.2.10.

I just created an app to practice with Karma/Jasmine and state management with NGXS.
It doesn't do much but hey, I don't care! ðŸ¤ 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests
